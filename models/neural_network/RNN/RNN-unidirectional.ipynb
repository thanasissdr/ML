She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.\\n\\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\\tus  to\\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\\n\\n\\n    by Brendan Arthur\\n\\n-- \\nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \\nViva Cristo Rey !!

(Both of them go beyond David in\\n&gt;history)  Acording to some of my Jewish friends, \"Jewishness\" is passed\\n&gt;to a child by the mother and the legal rights of \"Jewishness\" are passed\\n&gt;through the father.  If it is true that one of these geneologies is\\n&gt;Mary's, then Christ's bloodline is from David through His mother.  This\\n&gt;also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of\\n&gt;David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as\\n&gt;well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ's LEGAL FATHER.\\n\\nThe argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n</td>\n",

       "1  From: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au\\nSubject: St. Maria Goretti\\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\\nLines: 125\\n\\nHeres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of\\nthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine \"Morning Star\".\\n\\nHope you like it.\\n\\n    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti\\n\\n\\n\\n    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,\\n    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.

According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n\n",
